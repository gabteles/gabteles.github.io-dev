I'm always trying to learn or do something new, even when it's useless. Take a look at some of my personal projects in which I've worked on:

### [RbTSCP](https://github.com/gabteles/RbTSCP)
Ruby implementation of [Tom Kerrigan's Simple Chess Program (TSCP)](http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/TSCP/), for sure not the best implementation that it can have, since this implementation was made just to work and be improved later. It's ELO is about 1370, it means that it can win from newbies and some average players.

### [ZombieRB](https://github.com/gabteles/ZombieRB)
Implementation of the ZOMBIE-ORIENTED MACHINE BEING INTERFACE ENGINE (Zombie). You know, like Hex, but with evil beings! Written in Ruby to offset the evil a bit. Evil necromancers might want to [go here](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/zombie.html) to read the specification.

### [gulp-less2sass](https://github.com/gabteles/gulp-less2sass)
This was my first NPM package and Gulp plugin released, it was made to learn how to do both. It takes [Less](http://lesscss.org/) code and transpiles to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Will not work with all Less codes, but it was not the purpose.

### [Interest Guesser POC](https://github.com/gabteles/interest-guesser-poc) and [Interest Guesser](https://github.com/gabteles/interest-guesser)
Interest Guesser learn the user's interests and then guesses about. It was made to learn some new things like Node.JS, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing. The POC was a success, then I keep the idea and tried to learn some things more: [Spring](http://spring.io/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/), [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and REST APIs. Unfortunately, I've not finished the Java version, but I've learned much of what was purposed.

### [Befunge-93 Interpreter](https://github.com/gabteles/BefungeInterpreter)
This is a Ruby implementation of Befunge's interpreter. It means that you can run befunge code inside your ruby application and get it's output during runtime. *"Befunge is a two-dimensional fungeoidal (in fact, the original fungeoid) esoteric programming language invented in 1993 by Chris Pressey with the goal of being as difficult to compile as possible."* - [Esolangs](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge)

### [RPG Maker Game.exe in Ruby](https://gist.github.com/gabteles/10000006)
Ruby implementation of RPG Maker's Game.exe. Implementations in C and C++ were kind confuse before it. Main objetive with this implementation was to show initialization cycle in a more readable way.

### [Ruby Brainf**k](https://gist.github.com/gabteles/5996335)
Brainf**k language implementation in Ruby.

### [Big Factorial](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/gabteles/BigFactorial)
Calculate large number's factorial using Stirling's Approximation. For a given number N, will return the significant digits and the exponent for scientific notation of N!.
